# Cryptography
##### James Edwards, December 2016

#### Overview
This project contains several different implementations of ciphers, inspired by
Simon Singh's *[The Code Book](http://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/)*. Currently
it includes 3 ciphers:
1. a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher),
which works by replacing each letter in the plaintext with a letter that is some
constant number of spaces away in the real alphabet.
2. a [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher),
which works by replacing each letter in the plaintext according to a constant cipher
alphabet.
3. a custom shifting substitution cipher, which works in the same way as a normal
substitution cipher, except that it shifts the alphabet used by some constant number
of positions after each letter is substituted.

#### Compiling

Compilation is simple: the user can either manually run `javac *.java` or use the customized `make` command from the root directory. Either option will compile all of the necessary java files. The command `make clean` can be used to remove the `.class` files that are generated by compilation.

#### Running

To run the test file, the user may use the command `make run` or `java Tester`. The user should manually fill in the file `input.txt` with whatever text they would like to be encoded. The test program will then output the original contents of the input file, followed by the contents of the file after the various ciphers have been applied to it.
