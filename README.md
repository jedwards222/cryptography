# Cryptography
##### James Edwards, December 2016

#### Overview
This project contains several different implementations of ciphers, inspired by
Simon Singh's *[The Code Book](http://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/)*.

#### Compiling

Compilation is simple: the user can either manually run `javac *.java` or use the customized `make` command from the root directory. Either option will compile all of the necessary java files. The command `make clean` can be used to remove the `.class` files that are generated by compilation.

#### Running

To run the test file, the user may use the command `make run` or `java Tester`. The program will create a popup window that will prompt the user to select a plaintext file. The test program will then output the original contents of the selected file, followed by the contents of the file after the various ciphers have been applied to it.
